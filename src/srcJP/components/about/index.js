                    I'm an undergrad CS major looking roles in smaller
                    scale development teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm fairly new to CS, so I'm learning as I go along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in C, C++, HTML, Java, JavaScript,
                    MySQL, MongoDB, and some light understanding of MIPS
                    assembly language and Intel assembly language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've designed a few websites using HTML and React,
                    and I have experience working in groups for
                    projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, I'm working on Software Engineering skills
                    in a group project as a back-end developer and as
                    a Github manager.
